## Introduction

Svelte is a modern JavaScript framework that allows developers to create fast and efficient web applications. The official documentation is comprehensive but can be challenging to read on screens. This project aims to make the documentation more accessible by converting it into EPUB format, suitable for various e-readers, including Kindle.

The conversion process utilizes tools like BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and Jinja2 for templating. We also use Python 3 and the Requests library to fetch the latest documentation content. 

## Features

- **EPUB Format**: Read the Svelte documentation in a user-friendly format.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with various e-readers and devices.
- **Easy Updates**: Automatically fetch the latest documentation.
- **Customizable**: Modify the templates to fit your reading preferences.
